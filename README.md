# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the different data points collected across urban, suburban, and rural cities for PyBer Ride Sharing services to determine how to improve business across different areas. We are looking at fares, rides given, and number of drivers to pinpoint areas of opportunity for company growth.

## Results

Upon analyzing the PyBer data for rural, suburban, and urban cities between 1/1/2019 to 5/8/2019:

We can determine the following:

#### Total PyBer Rides – 2375
-	Urban cities give 68.4% of the total rides
-	Suburban cities give 26.3% of the total rides
-	Rural cities give 5.3% of the total rides

#### Total Drivers – 2973
-	80.9% of the drivers are in urban cities
-	16.5% of the drivers are in suburban cities
-	2.6% of the drivers are in rural cities

#### Total Fares - $63,538.64
-	Urban cities made 62.7% of the total fares
-	Suburban cities made 30.5% of the total fares
-	Rural cities made 6.8% of the total fares

#### Average Fare Per Ride
Rides in rural cities cost more than in suburban cities, which also cost more than in urban cities.

#### Average Fare Per Driver
Each rural driver brings in about 1.5 more than suburban drivers and 3 times more than urban drivers.

As you can see from this chart:
-	Urban cities made significantly more in total fares when compared to suburban and rural cities. This is not surprising considering that urban cities had about 3 times more rides than suburban cities and 13 times more than the rural areas.
-	There is a consistent spike in fares for each city around the week after Valentine’s Day.
-	The beginning of the year is the slowest time for urban cities

## Recommendations

1.	Data should be collected for an entire year to get a more well-rounded idea of how each city type performs throughout different weeks, months, holidays, and seasons.

2.	There are almost twice as many drivers in urban cities than there were rides taken. It could be a good idea to invest in more marketing and advertising to attract more riders, which would increase total fares. If following suggestion 1, we could see when all of the peaks would be throughout the year to help run different marketing campaigns during the busiest times so more potential riders have the opportunity to know about the service and use it.
    - A few marketing ideas:
      - Posters around entrances to cities, grocery stores, coffee shops, tourist attractions
      - Social media campaigns
        - Create a PyBer hashtag to encourage riders to post about the service or their rides
      - Ride perks
        - Every 5th ride get a % off the fare
        - Earn points to use - every 50 or 100 points get a free ride
        - Recommendation discount – every new rider you bring in, earn points or a % off

3.	Look into more specific factors with regard to rural cities:
    - Are riders traveling further distances, causing higher fares per ride?
      - It would be a good idea to collect data on the mileage traveled per ride to see if it could be used to improve total fares in both rural and suburban cities. 
    - Would adding more drivers help to increase total fares?
      - Is the demand for drivers being met, or are drivers occupied in travelling further distances with fewer riders?
      - Conducting a survey in rural communities would help give more insight into the supply vs the demand.
